# easy-arch-cmd
Easy script that lets you execute real arch linux commands through ubuntu/mint/deb

# Instalation
to install the commands it uses the folder `commands`
Give permissions to `install.sh` with the command `sudo chmod +x install.sh`
make sure to be root both with `su` or executing the command with `sudo`

# Fun facts
1. this script is made by an arch user
2. this has **horrible** bugs i have to fix
3. my Hard disk died so i had to make this script per EFI

# Note
`install.sh` doesnt work for now

# To be added
`apt install`
`apt update`
`apt upgrade` <-- possible not to be added
